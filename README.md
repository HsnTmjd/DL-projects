# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using Swin-B Transformer

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using the **Swin-B Transformer**, a vision transformer architecture that captures both **local** üîç and **global** üåç image features.  
The objective was to build a **robust deep learning model** capable of classifying MRI scans into **tumor** ü©ª and **non-tumor** ‚úÖ categories.

## Our Solution
We designed and trained a Swin-B Transformer on preprocessed MRI datasets with data augmentation techniques, including **thermal augmentation** üå°Ô∏è, to enhance feature extraction.  
After **100 epochs**, the model achieved:  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~100%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** **91.18%**

## Key Highlights
- Preprocessed MRI images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  
- Implemented the **Swin-B Transformer** for accurate classification.  
- Achieved **91.18% validation accuracy**, demonstrating strong generalization.  
- Future improvements:  
  - Expanding dataset diversity.  
  - Optimizing model robustness.  
  - Enhancing interpretability using techniques like Grad-CAM or attention visualization.
